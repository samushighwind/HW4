(There was no satisfiable solution requiring each student to have a full schedule with 4 courses, given other constraints).

New Webtree with additional constraint of minimum 3 fulfilled requests per student is notable, in that while granting fewer full schedules than any of the other schemes, it is able to grant both the highest average number of courses per student and the highest satisfaction score per granted course. Thus, it is easily preferred to the original Webtree scheme so long as we assume students will later be able to add additional courses in order to achieve full schedules.
