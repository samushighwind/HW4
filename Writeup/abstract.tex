\begin{abstract}

The current system for selecting courses at Davidson College is known as
``Webtree''. Webtree selects courses for students, in order of class
seniority, in a random order within their class. This outdated system has been
in place for decades, and is inflexible---always following the same
iterative method of assigning courses to students. We attempt to redesign
Webtree such that it selects courses for students in a more efficient
and flexible way. By framing the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, we
have created a more optimal solution to assigning courses than the current system.
