\label{sec:concl}

This study sought to establish a novel method for assigning courses at
Davidson College by framing the problem as a constraint satisfaction
problem. After a comparative analysis of the old system of Webtree and
our new method, using a psuedoboolean SAT solver, we conclude that our
solution assigns courses in a manner that gives more students all four
courses (i.e. a full course-load), as well as three courses. While the
old Webtree algorithm assigns a higher average of courses to each
student (3.735) than our approach without minimum courses as a
constraint (3.716), adding a constraint that requires each student to
receive a minimum of 3 courses was found to result assigning the
maximum average number of courses to each student
(3.746). Additionally, while not adding constraints that require a
minimum number of courses to be fulfilled per student resulted in a
lower average courses per student, students can easily add more
courses after the algorithm has run during the add/drop period. 

Future research should examine what sorts of additional constraints or constraint
modifications could result in improved scheduling, as well as suitable ways to
incorporate desired hierarchical schemas such as class and lottery number. Does
there exist a constraint schema that can supply a higher number of completed
schedules than vanilla Webtree, while simultaneously returning a higher number
of fulfilled requests and a higher score of course satisfaction?
