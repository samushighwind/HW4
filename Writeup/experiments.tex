Each variable $x_i$ represented one full Webtree request by a
student. Thus, setting that variable true indicates that that course
is granted to that particular student. Our constraint set consisted of
four subsets: ensuring that each student would not receive the same
course (of any and all sections) more than once, ensuring that each
student would not receive more than four courses, ensuring that
enrollment for each course fell under or equal to the course ceiling,
and ensuring that each student received $n$ number of courses. The
last constraint was varied from {0-4}, which allows us to treat it as
a ``soft constraint'', as setting $n=0$ is similar to saying that
the constraint does not need to be followed. 

To create our minimization function, we subtracted our rank from 8 (so
that a score of 7 was now the maximum), then negated. This was done
because we want the best courses to minimize the function the greatest.


We used Sat4j's psuedoboolean solver to solve this constraint
satisfaction problem, a free open-source java implementation \cite{sat4j}.
