\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Present the results of your experiments. Simply presenting the data is
insufficient! You need to analyze your results. What did you discover?
What is interesting about your results? Were the results what you
expected? Use appropriate visualizations. Prefer graphs and charts to
tables as they are easier to read (though tables are often more
compact, and can be a better choice if you're squeezed for space).
\textbf{Always} include information that conveys the uncertainty in
your measurements: mean statistics should be plotted with error bars,
or reported in tables with a $\pm$ range. The $95\%$-confidence
interval is a commonly reported statistic.

% insert figures (like figure~\ref{fig:tex}) or plots into your

%   % The label is a handle you create so that you can refer to this
%   % figure (using the \ref{} command) from other parts of your
%   % document. LaTeX automatically renumbers figures and updates
%   % references when you recompile, so you should do it this way rather
%   % than hard-coding in references. Notice that I've also been
%   % creating labels for the various sections in the document; I could
%   % use \ref{} command to refer to those sections using their labels
%   % too.
